### SME based business process modelling
SME stands for situational method engineering which preaches reusiability and flexibility of atomic method fragments and chunks instead of traditional non-modular 
methods used in current software industries. For creating a BPM (business process modelling) application, we will use "Business canvas (Alexander osterwalder)" for 
requirement gathering.

### Constructing an SME based BPM application will have three major steps:
- [x] Define a meta model for the application domain [[link]](https://github.com/G0URAB/sme/blob/master/documents/MetaModel.pdf)
- [x] Identify and construct atomic method components such as chunk/fragments and 
create repository consisting of these fragments [[link]](https://github.com/G0URAB/sme/blob/master/documents/Fragment%20construction%20for%20business%20process%20modelling.pdf)
- [ ] Create a process model explaining the work-flow of the fragments (**Work under progress**)
- [ ] Assemble the method components to form a methodology which will present an
organization level method (**Work under progress**)
- [ ] Tailor the method in hierachical level if required (**Work under progress**)

### Run the application
- The implmentation has been partly done and much work is still pending.
- We have used PHP,Sqlite,HTML,CSS and jQuery to develop the app.
- To run the application download the project and in the root folder start a shell and type php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
- Finally in a web-browser type the address "127.0.0.1:8000"
